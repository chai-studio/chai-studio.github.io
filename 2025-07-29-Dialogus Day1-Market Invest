## 📚 What’s Already Out There? A Market Scan

Before building 小书童, I wanted to see what tools already exist to help college students read better and think deeper—especially in a seminar-style setting.

## 🚧 What’s Still Missing?

Despite these tools, there are still major gaps when it comes to reading in a reflective, seminar-style environment:

- **Pre-reading guidance** – No tool tells you what to watch for or how to connect it to past learning.
- **Post-reading reflection** – Very few help you ask questions or prep for class discussions.
- **Active engagement** – Most tools just summarize; they don’t guide your thinking or challenge you.
- **Knowledge synthesis** – Nothing really connects ideas across readings or builds your personal knowledge tree.
- **Personalized support** – Current tools don’t remember you, your habits, or struggles.

## 💡 Why I’m Building 小书童 | Dialogus

Inspired by these gaps, my next product will be called **Dialogus**—a reading companion that brings back the art of questioning and conversation.

> It won’t just give you answers. It will help you ask better questions.

MVP features will include:
- Contextual questions before you read
- Interactive chat during reading to clarify or reflect
- Post-reading prompts to help you prep for class
- Option to save insights, map key concepts, and return to them later

It’s Socratic, Confucian, and Zhuangzian—through and through.

Stay tuned. Tomorrow I’ll start designing the interface and prompt engine.
