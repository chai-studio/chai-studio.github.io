👋 **Hello and welcome to CHAI Studio!**

I am a humanist, traveler, writer, mother, wondering about the future of past in the age of AI. 
This is my tiny corner of the web where I’ll be exploring the space between **AI and Chinese Humanities**.

- 🏗️ I want to become an indie creator through building tiny products in the next few weeks  
- 📝 I’ll share reflections and lessons learned here  
- 🤝 I hope to connect with curious (or wandering) minds along the way  

Right now we’re in **Week 0**—just setting up the foundations.  
Stay tuned for **Week 1 in August**, where I’ll kick off with a simple habit-tracking app for Morning Goals & Evening Gratitude.

Thanks for visiting—more soon! 🌱
