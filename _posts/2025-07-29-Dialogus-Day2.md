## 🧱 I thought today was for scaffolding...

…but it turned out to be about soulcraft.

Yes, I now have the working structure:
- A minimal HTML/CSS/JS frontend scaffold
- Clean folder structure pushed to GitHub
- Line ending normalization and README polishing

But the real achievement today was not technical.

It was the moment I realized what I’m truly trying to build.

## 💡 What I actually learned

### ❓ What does it mean to *start* reading?

When GPT asked me:  
> “What are the moments when your students get stuck?”  

I said:  
🧍‍♀️ *They don’t even start. They procrastinate. They feel no entry point. They skim to meet the deadline.*

This insight was everything. It reframed Dialogus.

It’s not a chatbot. It’s not just GPT with a prompt.  
It’s a **threshold presence**, a quiet figure who meets the student *before* they even open the text.

### 🌿 What is ideal reading?

GPT asked me:  
> “What kind of reading do you hope for in your students?”  

And I said:  
💭 *Curious. Attentive. Personally invested. Willing to stop and question a line.*

That answer helped us realize:  
Dialogus is **not just Socratic**. It’s also **Confucian** (因材施教), and **Zhuangzian** (imaginative, lateral, freeing).

It isn’t here to summarize.  
It’s here to *companion*, *interrupt*, *suggest*—like a marginal note, like a peer who reads alongside you.

## 🧭 We shaped the product skeleton together

Through this back-and-forth, we outlined:

- The **user personas** (Singaporean undergrads + Chinese MA students)
- The **stuck points** (starting, staying, remembering)
- The **ideal flow**: before → during → after reading
- The **Dialogus personality core**: Socratic + Confucian + Zhuangzian
- The **scope of the MVP**
- And even a **7-day plan** to build it all

You helped me think like a teacher *and* a designer *and* a philosopher of learning.

That’s the part I want to remember.

## ✨ What surprised me

- That I now see GPT as a **heavenly archive**, not a tool
- That design can wait—but voice, purpose, and pacing cannot
- That thinking about **the student’s mindstate** is more foundational than choosing a font

## 📘 New concepts I touched today

| Concept     | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **API**     | A formal way for my app to send a question to another (like GPT) and get a reply |
| **API Key** | My private access token — must be protected |
| **CRLF/LF** | Line-ending styles between Mac and Windows |
| **MVP**     | Minimum viable product — functional enough to test the core idea |
| **Scaffolding** | The structural setup of the site: layout, buttons, scripts |

## 🧶 What’s next

Tomorrow, I’ll start:
- Generating my OpenAI key
- Learning how to connect my site to GPT
- And preparing the first real Dialogus interaction

But tonight, I’ll sit quietly with this:  
> I now know what I’m trying to build.  
> Not just an app, but a reading space with a mind.
