After saying **Hello World**, today I took the first real step in shaping my 8-week indie creator journey.

### 🗂️ Deciding the sequence of my app creator journey

I realized that **how I order my projects matters.** Each week should build a new skill that helps me create the next app.

So I’ll start with **simple, foundational projects** that focus on user experience—like a tiny habit tracker for Morning Goals & Evening Gratitude. Once I’m comfortable with UI and basic data flow, I’ll move toward **AI-interactive projects**, like reading companions for my students, or language tools for refugee camps.

This sequence feels like **learning to walk before I run**—layering small wins toward bigger ideas.

### 🌐 Learning GitHub & Jekyll to host this website

Today I also **brought this website to life** at [chaistudio.org](https://chaistudio.org).  

Here’s what I learned:  

- **Jekyll** is a static site generator that converts Markdown into a styled website  
- **Git** is like a time machine for files—it tracks every change  
- **GitHub Pages** automatically runs Jekyll and hosts my site for free  
- I can connect my own domain, making the site feel *truly mine*  

I went from *“what is a repo?”* to creating one, uploading a theme, editing `_config.yml`, and seeing my site go live.

### 🌱 Reflections

Even though this was just a **technical foundation**, it already feels like a breakthrough.  

Learning new tools feels like **learning a new language**—confusing at first, but gradually the pieces start to connect. And seeing `chaistudio.org` load for the first time was a tiny but powerful win.  

Tomorrow, I’ll keep building—step by step.
