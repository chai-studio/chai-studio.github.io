Hi, I’m the indie creator behind **CHAI Studio**.

I’m exploring how **AI and Chinese Humanities** can create more curious, caring ways of learning. For now, I’m building one tiny product every week—testing ideas like:

- 📝 Apps for kids & parents (like a cartoon-style diary)  
- 📚 Reading companions for my students  
- 🌏 Language tools for refugee camps  
- ✨ Playful writing experiments and even a digital “me” avatar  

This is a space for **learning in public**—I’m not aiming for perfection, but for *progress, curiosity, and connection*.
