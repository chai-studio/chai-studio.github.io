title: "Welcome to CHAI Studio"

**CHAI Studio** is a small, quiet corner where I explore the space between **Chinese Humanities and AI.**

I come from a world of **classical languages and literature**, where a single line of poetry from a thousand years ago can open an entire universe of thought. I often ask myself:  

- *How close, how intimate, how relevant are those voices from the past to me today?*  
- *And what about those absent voices—women, children, the vulnerable—who are barely represented in the sources we have?*  

I believe in **slow reading** and even in challenging the very idea of *productivity*. Yet, like many, I struggle with the demands of modern life. My students rarely hold a paper book or read a long story—but they devour hundreds of short videos and log into certain platforms every day.  

So I find myself asking:  

> **What does “reading” mean in our current age? How is the past still relevant today?**  

CHAI Studio is my way of thinking through these questions—sometimes through words, sometimes through tiny experiments with AI, and sometimes through playful tools for learning and reflection.

I’m starting with an **8-week indie creator camp**, where I’ll build one small product each
