**CHAI Studio** is an indie playground for building tiny tools that explore the space between **AI and the Humanities**.

For 8 weeks, I’m creating one small product each week:

- ✨ Apps for kids & parents (like a cartoon-style diary)
- ✨ Reading companions for my students
- ✨ Language tools for refugee camps
- ✨ Playful writing experiments, gratitude trackers, and even a digital “me” avatar

I’m not here to build the next billion-dollar startup—just to **learn, share, and get closer to a future where education with AI feels more *human*.**

Follow along for **weekly builds, notes, and reflections** on what I’m learning.
